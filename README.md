This repository is the official implementation of ETCH, a novel body fitting pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth to the underlying body.

## News: 
- 2025-08-04: We release the `All-in-One` model, which is trained on the `4D-Dress` dataset, `CAPE` dataset, and Generative dataset, totally 94501 samples. Please download the all-in-one model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14zGMkmC580VLNgeUBFtM6FP8QX415VAa?usp=sharing).

- 2025-08-04: We release the code for `ETCH`, please feel free to have a try!



## Environment Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate etch
cd external
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus.git && cd theseus
pip install -e .
cd ../..
```

## Data Preparation
0. please note that we placed data samples in the `datafolder` folder for convenience. 
1. Generate Anchor Points with Tightness Vectors (for training)
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_infopoints.py
    ```

2. Get splitted ids (pkl file)
    ```bash
    python scripts/get_splitted_ids_{datasetname}.py
    ```
3. For body_models, please download with [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JNFk4OGfDkgE9WdJb1D1zGaECix8XpKV/view?usp=sharing), and place it under the `datafolder/` folder.

4. please note that before the above processes, there are some preprocessing steps on the original data: 

    for `4D-Dress` dataset, we apply zero-translation `mesh.apply_translation(-translation)` to the original scan and the body model; 
    
    for `CAPE` dataset, we used the processed meshes extracted from [PTF](https://github.com/taconite/PTF), in which we noticed that the SMPL body meshes are marginally different from the original SMPL body meshes but more precise.

## Dataset Organization
The dataset folder tree is like:  
```bash
datafolder/
├── datasetfolder/
│   ├── model/ # scans
│   │   ├── id_0
│   │   │   └── id_0.obj
│   ├── smpl(h)/ # body models
│   │   ├── id_0
│   │   │   ├── info_id_0.npz
│   │   │   └── mesh_smpl_id_0.obj # SMPL body mesh
├── useful_data_datasetname/
├── gt_datasetname_data/
│   ├── npz/
│   │   └── id_0.npz
│   └── ply 
│       └── id_0.ply
```
please refer to the `datafolder` folder for more details. 


## Training

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/train.py --batch_size 2 --i datasetname_settingname 
# batch_size should <= num_data, if you just have the sample data, you can set batch_size to 1
```

## Evaluation

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/eval.py --batch_size 3 --model_path path_to_pretrained_model --i datasetname_settingname

# please note that the train_ids has no overlap with the val_ids, the sample data is from train_ids, so if you want to test the pretrained model on the sample data, you should set the activated_ids_path to the train_ids.pkl file for successful selection.
```

## Pretrained Model
Please download the pretrained model used in the paper from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14zGMkmC580VLNgeUBFtM6FP8QX415VAa?usp=sharing). 


## 🔥 All-in-One Model 🔥
We provide the `All-in-One` model, which is trained on the `4D-Dress` dataset, `CAPE` dataset, and Generative dataset, totally 94501 samples. Please download the all-in-one model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14zGMkmC580VLNgeUBFtM6FP8QX415VAa?usp=sharing).

For demo inference, you can use the following command:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/inference_demo.py --scan_path path_to_scan_obj_file --gender gender --model_path path_to_allinone_pretrained_model
```

Please note that during the training of `All-in-One` model and in the `inference_demo.py` file, we centering the scan as input, and re-center the predicted SMPL mesh to the original scan.
For more details, please refer to the `src/inference_demo.py` file.

We also provide the animation function, which can be used to animate the scan with the predicted SMPL mesh. please refer to the `src/animation.py` file for more details.
